# Meme Marketplace

Full-stack capstone project: a simple meme marketplace where authenticated users can upload memes, browse/search the library, like memes, and perform basic "buy" actions.

This repo contains:
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Serverless Framework, AWS (S3, DynamoDB, Cognito), Prisma (SQLite for a small purchase-history model).
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS single-page application.

Region: `us-east-1`.

> Note: AWS credentials are configured in the underlying system; deploy steps will assume an authenticated AWS CLI in that environment.
